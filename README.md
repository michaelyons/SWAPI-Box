# SWAPI Box

SWAPI Box is dynamic single page application that lets users interact with data from the Star Wars API in order to brush up on their favorite characters, planets, and vehicles. Users can save their favorite items for later viewing, as well as read random intro movie quotes at the bottom of the screen.
